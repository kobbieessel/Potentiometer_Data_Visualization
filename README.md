# Potentiometer Data Visualization System

This project demonstrates real-time data acquisition and visualization using an Arduino and Python.  
The Arduino reads values from a potentiometer and sends them over serial, while Python plots the incoming data live to show how the potentiometer controls LED brightness.

---

## 📌 Overview

This system consists of two parts:

### **1. Arduino (C++)**
- Reads analog input from a potentiometer (`A0`)
- Converts the reading to LED brightness using PWM (`D6`)
- Sends the raw potentiometer value through serial at 115200 baud

### **2. Python Visualization**
- Receives the serial data from the Arduino
- Computes LED brightness from the potentiometer value
- Plots both values in real time using Matplotlib + Drawnow

This setup provides a clear visual understanding of sensor behavior and system response.

## 📈 Importance of Data Visualization

Data visualization transforms raw serial output into meaningful insight.
In this project, visualization helps you:

- See sensor values change instantly
- Verify hardware responsiveness
- Understand how analog input maps to PWM brightness
- Detect noise, irregular readings, or latency
- Communicate system behavior clearly for reports, demos, or documentation

Visualization is essential in embedded systems for testing, debugging, and understanding real-world performance
